# YETUR
- Dedicated AntiCheat Plugin for Bedrock Dedicated Server + Node.js (BDSX)

## How can I use this plugin?
- This plug-in owns an authentication system.
- Let me tell you how to prove that you are not a robot.
- Download this plugin first.
- Insert "bdsx-master - plugin" into the plugin folder
- Type cmd in the "Run" window that appears by pressing the win+r shortcut and press Enter.
- If you type "ipconfig" in a black window, the "Link Local IPv6 Address" appears.
- You can forward this address to me.
- Discord: yetur#0687
- If you send it and get a reply, it means that the authentication has been completed.
- Now, try "bdsx.bat" and it works fine without errors.
